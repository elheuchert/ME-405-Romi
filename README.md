# ME 405 Romi Term Project

## Overview
This repository contains the source code used in our ME 405 Romi term project. Our goal for this project was to run and tune our Romi robot so that it could follow a course provided by our instructor. To achieve autonomous navigation, we used many sensor systems, starting with quadrature encoders that provided motor feedback for control through PD control. Reflectance sensors enabled us to detect lines on the track surface, allowing for line-following. The IMU supplied orientation data for state estimation and heading correction. A Bluetooth module allowed for wireless data transfer, helpful for running tests. Finally, Bump sensors provided collision detection for obstacle detection.
